React Suspense - <Suspense> lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.
React Error Boundaries - Error boundaries are React components which catch JavaScript errors anywhere in our app, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. It does not break the whole app component tree and only renders the fallback UI whenever an error occurred in a component. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering in component lifecycle methods, and constructors of the whole tree below them.
