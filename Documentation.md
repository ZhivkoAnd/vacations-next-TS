It is also known as on-demand loading because it only loads content visible on usersâ€™ screens.React lazy is a new function in react that lets you load react components lazily through code splitting without help from any additional third-party libraries.One approach to code-splitting React components is called route-based code-splitting, which requires applying dynamic import() to lazy load route components.

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
